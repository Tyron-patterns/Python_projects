# 🐍 Python Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python coding exercises and mini-projects. While many of these started as challenges from a course I attended, I completed them independently — using minimal external help aside from researching specific functions or syntax.

My goal was not just to follow instructions, but to understand the logic behind each problem and solve it on my own. 
✅<mark> In most cases, I extended the exercises beyond their original scope to explore more advanced solutions or improve the structure. </mark>✅

These are not full-scale applications, but rather individual coding exercises that reflect my learning process, creativity, and growing confidence in Python.

## 🚀 Highlights
- Built independently from scratch
- Minimal guidance — focused on self-learning
- Some projects go beyond the challenge requirements
- Organized as standalone files for clarity

## 📌 Note
These are just random Python exercises — but each one shows real progress in problem-solving, logic, and code structure.
