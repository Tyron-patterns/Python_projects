# 🐍 Python Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python coding exercises and mini-projects. While many of these started as challenges from courses I attended, I completed them independently — using minimal external help aside from researching specific functions or syntax.

> **Note:** My goal throughout this project was not merely to follow instructions, but to deeply understand the underlying logic of each problem and develop my own solutions.
> 
> **⚠️ In many cases,** I went beyond the original exercise requirements to explore more advanced approaches, optimize the structure, or test additional edge cases.
> 
> As a result, many of the exercises in this repository significantly exceed the original scope of the course's challenges.

These are not full-scale applications, but rather individual coding exercises that reflect my learning process, creativity, and growing confidence in Python.

## 🚀 Highlights
- Built independently from scratch
- Minimal guidance — focused on self-learning
- Many projects go beyond the challenge requirements
- Organized as standalone files for clarity

## 📌 Note
These are just random Python exercises — but each one shows real progress in problem-solving, logic, and code structure.
