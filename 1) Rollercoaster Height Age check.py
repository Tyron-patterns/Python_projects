# This script checks whether a person meets the height and age requirements for a rollercoaster ride. It uses two while loops to validate user input,
# and nested if/else statements to determine eligibility and pricing.
# NOTE: range(0,100) and .isdigit() (this one having clear limitations in the cope of the desired results) are redundant used in combination
# but intentionally used together to demonstrate multiple validation techniques.
# NOTE: creating a function in this case could have probably been the best option for multiple reasons (e.g. it would have allowed the use of "return"),
# but, again, the purpose was to experiment with the code (e.g. using exit())
